                You've landed on a weird website! What is it about? Well its just some stuff I like doing!<br>
                I've been working on this website for a few days now and I had fun making it. OH YES, intros are due!<br>

                ðŸ˜‚ okay jokes aside, I'm an undergrad student, currently in my sophomore year, pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing.<br>
                I love working with technology and making new things with it. I LOVE Mathematics! I'm also into Cyber Security.

                This website doesn't contain anything out of this world, its a pretty simple website written with simple code.<br>
                The only thing that might be of significance is that I didn't use any javascript here, I know, its not impressive, its actually bad but hey I wanted to try css and I did, you can't blame me.<br>
                Also it was very tiring to think about what to add on this website, especially the Home Page.<br>
                Fun fact: I added stuff that I found interesting and the stuff that I like in the other pages, which you can access using the navbar above.<br>
                Its not much but I hope you like this website :)
