            If you can't see the beauty of this equation yet then: <br>
            First, SAD! HOW? How could you not? I mean ...  Okay, I'll help you.
        </p>

        <div class="Images">

        <p style="font-size: 25px;">So, for the complete context, I'll explain.<br>
            The "e" here is Napier's constant, and its an irrational number, which means that it can't be expressed as a fraction.<br>
            The "i" here is called iota and its value is shown in the above image, its an imaginary number.<br>
            Everyone knows "π", our cute little irrational ratio.<br><br>

            So the beauty is, an imaginary number (i) when multiplied with an irrational number (π) and these raised to the power of another irrational number (e) become a whole number (i.e. '-1').<br><br>
            Keep in mind that "e" being an irrational number can't be expressed in the form of a rational number with any power.<br>
            So one might get quite curious that how is this equation even possible?<br>
            Well this equation comes from an another form of Euler's equation, which is also called, Euler's Identity.<br><br>

            It goes something like this:<br><br>
        </p>
            <div class="formula">
                e<sup>i∅</sup> = cos∅ + isin∅
            </div>
            <br><br>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">
            The sine and cosine are trigonometric ratios that work as functions and give values corresponding to those given as input, here '∅' is the input.<br>
            And when '∅' is equal to 'π' sine takes the value 0, because sinπ = 0 and cosine takes the value -1, because cosπ = -1.<br>
            Which makes our equation:<br><br>
        </p>
            <div class="formula">
                e<sup>iπ</sup> = -1.
            </div><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;;">
                Thankyou for bearing with me, if you think its too much, I don't blame you, but if you liked it then DUDE! I LIKE YOU!
